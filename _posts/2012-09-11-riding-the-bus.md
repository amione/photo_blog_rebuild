A brief intermission from the best of photos to tell this story.

This was a real guy holding onto the bumper. Unfortunately, I missed the part where he let go, got up, dusted himself off and walked away. It seemed like had no connection to the bus at all. He was just catching a strange ride, because the bus just kept on driving.
