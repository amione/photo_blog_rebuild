Why is it that when you order squid, they only give you rings and none of the tentacles? Even at authentic Asian places. I think it is because none of the squid is fresh. It's all frozen and pre-packaged without the tentacles. There are only a few places I know of that have them. Sushi and Shabu Shabu places (where you may be presented with raw squid) and select Italian restaurants. I can't be the only one who wants the tentacles can I?
