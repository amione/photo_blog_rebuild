This piece of graffiti is in Chinatown right by the RMV. The building is pretty old and is currently being renovated or maybe even torn down. I can't remember, but I'm pretty sure there was a building right next to it that did get torn down a few years ago, so this spray painting was put up there between then and now (you will have to click to see the full image because the graffiti isn't visible at thumbnail size). It always amazes me how the artists get access to some of the places they leave their marks. This one is particularly impressive, although not quite as impressive as some of the places that Kid or PK who work in the NJ and New York area leave their mark.
