I think the best beer I ever tasted was the 10th Anniversary IPA that Stone Brewing Co. released (apparently six years ago), because I just recently had the 16th Anniversary IPA. It's delicious, but I'm not sure it's better than the 10th, but at this point I've probably hyped that beer up so much in my mind that nothing will ever be "better".

Here are a few shots of the bottle and cap (still figuring out this camera). The flame effect was achieved by putting a crumpled up paper towel behind the bottle. Go figure.
