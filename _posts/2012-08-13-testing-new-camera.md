I'm going to Burning Man this year (I ended up selling my tickets last year), and I wanted to be able to capture some of the spectacle better than my samsung omnia i910 smartphone can. So I found a good deal on an Olympus EPL-1 mirrorless micro 4/3 camera (not the latest model). I took it out to learn how to use it, and here are some of my favorite shots from that walkabout.
