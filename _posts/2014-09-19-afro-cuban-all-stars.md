Saw the Afro-Cuban All Stars at the National Hispanic Cultural Center. I showed up late and they had stopped selling tickets. I actually lucked out. I just walked in past security like I belonged and nobody stopped me. I kept my hands mostly in my pockets since I didn't have a wrist band. Unfortunately my phone was acting up and I missed some of the best songs. My phone recorded them, but then freaked out because it was out of space.
