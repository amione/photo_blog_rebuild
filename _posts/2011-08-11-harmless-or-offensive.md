Saw this public service announcement on the Framingham/Worcester line of the the commuter rail. It translates as, "It's as clear as black and white. The Asian Longhorned Beetle kills trees. If you find it. Notify us. BeetleBusters.info."

What struck me about the poster was that it makes a lot of assumptions. The poster was in Spanish, and I didn't see an English version on the train. There wasn't even an English translation on the poster. This implies that the U.S. Department of Agriculture believes that Spanish speaking people riding the Framingham/Worcester line cannot read English and that their work is likely to involve manual labor outside in places where they could encounter the beetle, such as landscaping jobs.

I think this poster is kind of offensive.
