The Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque, NM (Sandia is Watermelon in Spanish). Different perspectives of the same mountains. I do what I can with the camera on my cell phone. The first photo looks at the mountains from one side of the city. The second looks out on the city while headed up the mountains on the Sandia Peak Tramway, which happens to be the third longest single span tramway in the world. The third, shows the view from the top of the mountains looking out away from the city.
