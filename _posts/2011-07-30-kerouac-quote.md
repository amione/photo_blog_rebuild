I had never noticed this quote written on a wall near the Boylston T Stop before. Not sure if someone recently wrote it in chalk, or if it was an advertisement which had been covered up, and now is uncovered. The fact that it is the same yellow as the yellow swoop above it makes me think advertisement. I'm going to try and wipe it off next time I walk by it. I will post back with the results of said experiment. 

Update: It's definitely not chalk. It seems like it was painted on maybe. Definitely an advertisement. It's too upbeat a message for some art student to have written.
